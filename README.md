# ðŸŽ¨ Designs Repository

This repository presents a curated collection of design assets developed for different companies and projects. The structure ensures clarity, consistency and ease of access for stakeholders reviewing visual materials.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

All files are organized in this repository. Each company or project has its own folder, containing:

  Optimized design exports: i.e (`.webp`) prepared for quick previews and usage.  
  ðŸ‘‰ Standard export: **2000 px** width, preserving aspect ratio.

**Original Files (Private)**
Source design files (e.g., `.ai`, `.psd`, `.fig`) are **kept private** to protect the work and keep it secure.

**Example Layout:**

```

repo/
  company-a/
    logo-1.webp
    banner-2.webp
    mockups/
      business-card.webp
    original-files/  # private file
      
  company-b/
    logo-1.webp

```
