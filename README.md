# ðŸŽ¨ Designs Repository

This repository presents a curated collection of design assets developed for different companies and projects. The structure ensures clarity, consistency and ease of access for stakeholders reviewing visual materials.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

All files are organized under the `docs/` directory. Each company or project has its own folder, containing:

* **image-files/**
  Optimized design exports (`.png`) prepared for quick previews and usage.  
  ðŸ‘‰ Standard export: approximately **1000 px** width, with aspect ratio preserved for quality consistency.

* **Original Files (Private)**
  Source design files (e.g., `.ai`, `.psd`, `.fig`) are **kept private** to protect the work and keep it secure.

**Example Layout:**

```
docs/
  company-name/
    image-files/
      logo-1.png
      banner-2.png
    (original design files remain private)
```

## ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights

* **Professional Organization** â€“ Assets are structured and consistently named for easy navigation.
* **Visual Readiness** â€“ Exported files are ready for quick review and reference.
* **Confidentiality Maintained** â€“ Original source files are protected to respect privacy and ownership.
